				<h4>What is Artgame Club?</h4>
				<p>Every month we pick a game and discuss it at in the following meetup. Games are nominated, voted on and chosen within our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/MrPzZXH">Discord</a>. We focus on free or inexpensive games with a playtime of anywhere between a few minutes to a few hours. The weirder the better! It's a great opportunity to explore some lesser known games and hopefully it will serve as inspiration too!</p></br>
